## ‚åõ Task
We needed to solve the problem of binary classification for "Citylink" customers in order to predict which people would leave, which ones would stay

## üíæ Data + Models
We were given a checklist of all transactions for the last 2 months, where in each line it was written: [contract_id], [event_date], [event_type]. I did the preprocessing, compiled a table (Value_count + TF-IDF) and trained CatBoost to classify users.
